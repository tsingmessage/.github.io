I am a PhD researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam [(BIGR)](https://bigr.nl/) at [Erasmus MC](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Wiro J. Niessen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jmKtufcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Eppo B. Wolvius](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/nl-nl/patientenzorg/zorgverleners/wolvius-eppo), and [Dr. Gennady V. Roshchupkin](https://www.roshchupkin.org/). Earlier, Iâ€™ve completed my Bachelors and Masters from [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), and gained industrial experience as a R&D engineer at [Shenzhen Wisonic Co., Ltd](https://www.wisonic.com/en/). and a researcher at [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) in collaboration with [Esquel Group](https://www.esquel.com/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
