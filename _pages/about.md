I am a PhD researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam [(BIGR)](https://bigr.nl/) at [Erasmus MC](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Wiro J. Niessen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jmKtufcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Eppo B. Wolvius](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/nl-nl/patientenzorg/zorgverleners/wolvius-eppo), and [Dr. Gennady V. Roshchupkin](https://www.roshchupkin.org/). Earlier, Iâ€™ve completed my Bachelors and Masters from [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), and gained industrial experience as a R&D engineer at [Shenzhen Wisonic Co., Ltd](https://www.wisonic.com/en/). and a researcher at [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) in collaboration with [Esquel Group](https://www.esquel.com/).

I mainly work on the interpretability and confounding problems in machine learning and deep learning, with applications in population-based genetic and epidemiological studies.
