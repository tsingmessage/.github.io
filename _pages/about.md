I am a PhD researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam [(BIGR)](https://bigr.nl/) at [Erasmus MC](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Wiro J. Niessen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jmKtufcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Eppo B. Wolvius](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/nl-nl/patientenzorg/zorgverleners/wolvius-eppo), and [Dr. Gennady V. Roshchupkin](https://www.roshchupkin.org/). Earlier, Iâ€™ve completed my Bachelors and Masters from [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), and gained industrial experience as a R&D engineer at [Shenzhen Wisonic Co., Ltd](https://www.wisonic.com/en/). and a researcher at [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) in collaboration with [Esquel Group](https://www.esquel.com/).

I mainly work on the interpretability and confounding problems in deep learning, with applications in population-based genetic and epidemiological studies, by using data sets from the [Generation R Study](https://generationr.nl/researchers/) and the [Rotterdam Study](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/core-facilities/ergo-the-rotterdam-study). I have extensive collaborations with other researchers. For internal collaborations within Erasmus MC, I work closely with [Manfred Kayser](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/researchers/kayser-manfred) from department of genetic identification, and [Marlies Wakkee](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/nl-nl/kankerinstituut/patientenzorg/zorgverleners/wakkee-marlies) from department of dermatology. For external collaborations, I work closely with the public health school in Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the public health school of Harvard University. Please find my [publication list](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m2qycVQAAAAJ&hl=en) for the research output from these collaborations.
