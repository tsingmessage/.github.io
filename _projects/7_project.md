I have an available 10-month project for master thesis. Please contact [me](https://tsingmessage.github.io/) if you are interested in it or have any questions.

Research question:
Methodology-wise: to develop a novel algorithm for analyzing association between two high-dimensional (e.g., image) domains
Application-wise: to explore the association between hand skeleton (growing) and facial morphology (development), and link it with genetics

Data set:
Sevearl thousands of hand skeleton x-ray image (at 9 and 13 years), 3D facial mesh image (at 9 and 13 years) and SNP-based genotype data for each subject, from the [Generation R Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826450/).
Sevearl thousands of hand skeleton x-ray image (age > 50), 3D facial mesh image (age > 50) and SNP-based genotype data for each subject, from the [Rotterdam Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-017-0321-4).

Methods:
Explainable Deep learning, confounder control, image analysis, genome-wide-association study (GWAS)
