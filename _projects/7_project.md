I have an available 10-month project for master thesis. You will be working with me, [Gennady](https://www.roshchupkin.org/) and [Joyce](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/researchers/meurs-joyce-van). Please contact [me](https://tsingmessage.github.io/) if you are interested in it or you have any questions.

Research question:<br>
Methodology-wise: to develop a novel algorithm for analyzing associations between two high-dimensional (e.g., image) domains <br>
Application-wise: to explore the association between hand skeleton (e.g., length of the finger) and facial morphology (e.g., width of the nose), and link it with genetics

Data set:<br>
Sevearl thousands hand skeleton X-ray images (at 9 and 13 years), 3D facial mesh images (at 9 and 13 years) and whole-genome SNP-based genotype data for each subject, from the [Generation R Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826450/).<br>
Sevearl thousands hand skeleton X-ray images (age > 50), 3D facial mesh images (age > 50) and whole-genome SNP-based genotype data for each subject, from the [Rotterdam Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-017-0321-4).

Datailed Tasks:<br>
This project is divided into 3 phase:<br>
Phase I: To explore the connection between the hand skeleton (e.g., length of the finger) and facial morphology<br>
...1) Develop a pipeline to automatically derive measurements (e.g, length of the finger) from x-ray hand skeleton image<br>
...2) Derive measurements from the facial mesh image. This part was done already.<br>
...3) Perform analysis to calculate the connection between hand measurements and facial measurements. <br>

Phase II: To further explore the grow patterns of the connection, in 9 to 13 years old children data<br>
...To be explored<br>

Phase III: If there exist some connections, try to explain the underlying mechanism (e.g., genetic determinants)<br>
...To be explored<br>

Please also note that Phase I is enough for a master thesis. <br>


Requirements:<br>
Preferred background in statistics, genetics, epidemiology, computer science, biomedical engineering. Experience with machine/deep learning and image processing is a plus.
